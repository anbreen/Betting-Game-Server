# Betting-Game-Server-In-C


A betting game server accepting clients on tcp sockets, letting the  clients pick a number within a published range, and every 15 seconds  randomize a winning number, and then letting the clients know if they  won or not.

The program must accept both IPv4 and IPv6 connections on TCP port and handle up to BEGASEP_NUM_CLIENTS clients. The code must allow for this define to range from 1 to 64500.
An unique client id must be generated upon receipt of a BEGASEP_OPEN message, this client id must never collide with another connected client.

If the maximum number of simultaenous clients is reached the server  must tear down the connection, else it must respond to the BEGASEP_OPEN  message with a BEGASEP_ACCEPT message with the allocated client id and  the allowed betting number range.
When the client has sent a BEGASEP_BET message, which must follow no  other message than BEGASEP_ACCEPT and have a betting number within the published range, the server is to include that client in the next betting run.
The client must only send the BEGASEP_BET message once, any protocol  breaches must immediately result in a connection teardown by the server.
A betting run must be performed every 15 seconds but only if there are  clients connected.

The betting run must generate a random number within the published  betting number range and broadcast the winning number to all clients with 
the BEGASEP_RESULT message, indicating for each client if they won or not. 
Each winner should also be printed on a seperate line to stdout, syslog,
or similar.
The connection to each client that betted in this run must then be closed.

The program must be able to run "forever" without interaction
